# kart-nodejs
## About
Made using JavaScript and node.js as a learning project. Uses the fundamentals of JavaScript (if/else, switch-case, for-loops, functions, arrays, objects and spread operators), along with intermediate concepts like asynchronous functions.

## Rules
Each player rolls a six-sided die and adds their attribute to the result, with the attribute depending on the block chosen at random.
Whoever has the biggest result wins the round, with the overall winner being determined after five rounds total.
